<!-- Ticket 4-b:
  Per Matthew Robis in Explorer Q&A with Suzanne:
    I think the link in the ticket is wrong
    It points to  https://youtu.be/0Qy8QWNQr5k?si=7paonX7ehYirQKJV and the correct link is 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9aOPPb_3ZA&list=PLuePfAWKCLvXDmUCkglj2na2f4TCvCfLg&index=204

<!-- Ticket 3: What is the DOM?
  There *are* better ways to capture all instances of a class
  Also important to note that "class" and "ID" are used for CSS styling,
    where "class" can be used multiple times and "ID" should be unique
  However, there's also things like "data" ("data ID"?) that can be used
    to manipulate the data (i.e., dynamically force data updates) --
    this is currently the preferred method
  When you have full control of the layout, you can structure it how you need,
    so using "ID" (which is typically used for CSS styling) is technically fine
  When looking for "class," the first will be returned with ".querySelector,"
    but there are other options in the MDN docs (perhaps ".querySelectorAll"),
    which could potentially be stored in an array and looped over to change all instances
  Conversely, looking for "ID" should only return one item (i.e., how I did it)
  Check out MDN web docs and other visual cheat sheets
